# Arista device definitions

This is a (partial) list of Arista switches, including their port
types, end-of-sale status, and final EOS release version.  Eventually,
this may morph into a tool for tracking Arista device abilities on
eBay and similar -- "show me prices for EOS devices that run at least
4.28 and support being a PTP 2-step boundry clock".

For now, we can partially answer "show me EOS devices that run at
least 4.28", but even that's somewhat useful, as that information is
tedious to extract from Arista's website.
